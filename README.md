# Maparo

## Installation

You can use pre-compiled releases compiled for Linux, Mac and Windows.

## Design Principles

- Modules can be used in parallel with other modules. Modules can be initiated
  several times. This allows more complex campaigns like *Realtime Response Under
  Load (RRUL)* like FLENT is doing.
- *Maparo* return either a JSON set or human formatted data. *Maparo* do
  not draw or visualize any data. To visualize data you can use Python
  scripts using the powerful and flexible matplotlib library.
- *Maparo* do not focus on collection OS internal stats for further analysis
  for now. This can later be added.

## Using Maparo from Third Party Tools/Scripts Automatically

Maparo will exit with return code 0 if everything went fine. If not return code 1 signals
the script that something went wrong. To communicate error, warning and debugging
information to the outside *maparo* will use STDERR. STDOUT is just use for analysis
data. This a script can trust that the outputed string is a pure JSON string (if enabled)
and not garbaged with other information.

```
maparo <args> | python3 graph-script.py -o output.png
```

## Parsing Format

*Maparo* will print out the results and the input parameters as well as other
gathered system parameters:

```
{
  "version" = "semver value",
  "system" = {
  },
  "input" " {
  },
  "output" : {
  },
}
```

## Development

### Install binary via

```
go get github.com/protocollabs/maparo/...
```

### Prepare Development Environment

For Debian based systems install go suite:

```
sudo apt-get install golang-go
```
